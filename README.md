# Quality-Assurance-Using-Machine-Learning
The main aim of this project is to predict the dimensions of a regular shaped object as accurate as possible. OpenCV has been used for this project.
When an object is moving on a conveyor belt for Quality check, we need to get the dimensions of the object. We consider dimensions from 3 different views. 
I used a prototype whose images are inside the images folder.
The images folder contains all the pics that I used for prediciting the dimensions. You can have a look at the overview.ppt file to get an overall idea of the project.
QualAssur.py contains the python code.
